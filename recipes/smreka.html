    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Smreka is a fermented beverage whose origins remain somwhat shrouded in mystery.  The drink has become more popular in recent years in part thanks to an appearance in Sandor Katz's tome, "The Art of Fermentation" and a variety of blogs on the topic.</p>
    <p>Katz's book maintains the beverage originates in Bosnia, but there remains some uncertainty of the drink has cultural origins there or whether a small restaurant in Sarajevo just happened to serve it.  Either way, this sour tonic beverage is easy to make and absolutely delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups   dried juniper berries</li>
        <li>1 gallon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>Pour the juniper berries into a one gallon vessel and cover with the water.  Seal with a lid loosely attached such that fermentation gasses can escape.  Let rest on a shelf in a dark space for 30 days, shaking once per day to ensure no surface yeasts take hold.</p>
    <p>At the end of the 30 days or when you feel it is ready, strain the liquid into your preferred bottles, seal, and refrigerate.  If you would like a bit more effervescence, you can leave in sealed bottles on a counter for 1-2 days before refrigeration.</p>
